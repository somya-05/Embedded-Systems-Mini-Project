# Embedded-Systems-Mini-Project

The purpose of the project is to create an interface between an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and the system such that it measures distance and displays it on the LCD screen. We use C programming language to change and read register values on the LPC1768 microprocessor. The ultrasonic sensor has a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter transmits a signal which is reflected off a surface to the receiver. The distance is calculated using the speed of sound and time difference between transmitting and receiving the signal.
